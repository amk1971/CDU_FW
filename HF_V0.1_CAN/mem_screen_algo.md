Preset Management and Frequency Editing

Default and Deleted Presets:
By default, or when the user deletes a preset using the Delete button (the middle left soft button), presets P1 to P15 will display the text "EMPTY" in the frequency position.

Scrolling Through Presets:
Presets are displayed in groups of three (e.g., P1, P2, P3, etc.), and the user can scroll through these pages using the inner left knob.

Preset Selection and Display:
Soft buttons on the right correspond to the displayed presets (P1, P2, P3, etc.). The user can select a specific preset for editing or updating using these (Right) soft buttons.

Frequency Editing:

To edit a frequency, the user can use the right knob:
Inner knob: Adjusts the frequency in 50 kHz steps.
Outer knob: Adjusts the frequency in 1 MHz steps.
When the frequency is edited, the text "EMPTY" will be replaced, and the frequency adjustment starts from 108.00 MHz.

Saving the Frequency:

To save the updated frequency, the user must press the "SAVE" button (left bottom soft button).
Once saved, the frequency is stored in the selected preset (P1, P2, etc.), and the RCU will automatically return to the main screen.
The saved frequency will now appear in the Standby FrequencyÂ position.
